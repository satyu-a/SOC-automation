# SOC-automation

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a Hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) lab that simulates a real-world detection, analysis and response workflow. The lab focuses on:

- Endpoint Visibility through detailed telemetry collection and monitoring.
- Centralized log management and search to enable efficient threat hunting and incident detection.
- Intrusion Detection and monitoring across systems and networks.
- Automated case management and investigation to streamline incident handeling.
- Orchestration and automated response workflows to reduce manual efforts and improve SOC efficiency.

This environment provides a foundation for hands-on learning, threat detection experiments, and security automation, making it suitable for both research and demonstration of SOC capabilities.
